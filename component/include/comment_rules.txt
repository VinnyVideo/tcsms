<dd>Comments should be on topic - they should have something to do with the submission you're commenting on. For example, you might use the commenting system to critique someone's sprite sheet or ask for help on how to advance past a certain point in a fangame.</dd>
<dd>Be respectful of other users. Keep feedback constructive and civil.</dd>
<dd>Don't post or ask for commercial ROMs, software cracks, or other illegal content.</dd>
<dd>Don't post anything sexually provocative or otherwise not safe for work.</dd>
<dd>Avoid profanity and offensive language.</dd>
<dd>All comments should be written in English.</dd>
<dd>Don't constantly make requests for other people to make things for you. Requests should be polite and infrequent.</dd>
<dd>Spambots will be banned on sight.</dd>
<dd>Tell a staff member if someone might be breaking the rules or if something isn't working properly.</dd>
<dd>Consider the mainsite rules as an extension of the <a href="https://forums.mfgg.net/thread-195.html">forum rules</a>.</dd>
